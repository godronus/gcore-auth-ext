# gcore-auth-ext

Simple Browser Extension to repeatedly authenticate at click of a button

This addon is built using web-ext build command - there is no webpack or build script needed.

There is also a basic static site built from `./docs` folder. This allows us to self-host the addon on FastEdge.
